(Although, In this case, we are using a Python based commandline tool.)  Most importantly, you can launch many of these commands simultaneously from the commandline, computing everything in parallel using the multiple CPU core you have in your computer. If you have 4 core, you have the potential to process the data four times faster than a single-threaded Python program."
